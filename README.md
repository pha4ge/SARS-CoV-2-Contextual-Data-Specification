## PHA4GE overview

The Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology ([PHA4GE](https://pha4ge.org)) is a global coalition that is actively working to establish consensus standards, document and share best practices, improve the availability of critical bioinformatic tools and resources, and advocate for greater openness, interoperability, accessibility and reproducibility in public health microbial bioinformatics.

In the face of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, [PHA4GE](https://pha4ge.org) has identified a clear and present need for a fit-for-purpose, open source SARS-CoV-2 contextual data standard. As such, we have developed a SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification based on harmonizable, publicly available, community standards.

## SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification overview

Public health genomics contextual data includes sample metadata, lab/clinical/epidemiological data, and analysis methods information. Contextual data enables the interpretation of the sequence data, informs decision making for public health responses, and facilitates scientific understanding of infectious disease. Structured and consistent contextual data can also be more easily processed, aggregated, and reused by both humans and computers for different types of analyses.

The SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification includes a metadata collection template, reference guides, controlled vocabulary, and mapping to existing standards. We also provide a suite of protocols for submitting sequence data and contextual data to public repositories, enabling global interoperability of the data. The specification and all of the supporting materials are freely available and detailed below.

## Content description

### SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification package

#### [Spreadsheet-based (.xlsx) collection template](PHA4GE%20SARS-CoV-2%20Contextual%20Data%20Template.xlsx)

It contains the following items (tabs in the spreadsheet):

1. **a template for populating the complete set of contextual data;**

The collection template contains "required" (colour-coded yellow), "strongly recommended" (colour-coded purple) and "optional" (colour-coded white) fields.

2. **guidance for populating the template;**

The reference guide aims to facilitate the use of the collection template. It contains field definitions, further guidance/instructions, and examples of structured data.

3. **ontology-mapped controlled vocabulary for the picklists.**

Lists of controlled vocabulary, agreed upon by PHA4GE, are provided here for populating the template.

#### [The specification contextual data collection template in machine-amenable JSON format](PHA4GE_SARS-CoV-2_Contextual_Data_Schema.json)

Due to **JSON** format limitation, it deviates slightly from the collection template where the "required" (colour-coded yellow) fields are set as required and both the "strongly recommended" (colour-coded purple) and "optional" (colour-coded white) fields are both set as optional.

### Standard operating procedure

A **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** containing instructions for using the collection template.
This SOP provides users with step-by-step instructions for populating the template, looking up standardized terms, and how best to structure sample descriptions. Also included are a number of ethical, practical, and privacy considerations for data sharing. The SOP is available in protocols.io under the DOI [dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.btpznmp6](https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.btpznmp6).

### Supporting materials

#### [PHA4GE to WHO and sequence repository field mappings](PHA4GE%20to%20WHO%20and%20Sequence%20Repository%20Field%20Mappings.xlsx)

**WHO recommended contextual data mapping to PHA4GE fields**

PHA4GE fields are mapped to corresponding contextual data elements recommended by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization. Guidance for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants: interim guidance. WHO/2019-nCoV/surveillance/variants2021.1).

**PHA4GE to sequence repository field mappings**

A **mapping file** indicating which PHA4GE fields correspond to which fields within the different repository submission forms is provided to facilitate data transformations for submissions. Field mappings to the following repositories are available in the document:

- GISAID
- ENA
- NCBI

#### Submission protocols

Submission protocols are available for the following data repositories:

##### NCBI

The entire collection of submission protocols is available as a workflow at protocols.io under the DOI [dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bsypnfvn](http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bsypnfvn). This workflow includes the following individual protocols:

## JSON Specification Generation

The [JSON](PHA4GE_SARS-CoV-2_Contextual_Data_Schema.json) is produced automatically from the [csv version](PHA4GE%20SARS-CoV-2%20Standardised%20Terms.csv) of the template using the the script available from [SARS-CoV-2-Data-Spec-JSON](https://github.com/pha4ge/SARS-CoV-2-Data-Spec-JSON) repository.
